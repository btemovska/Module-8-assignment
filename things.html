      <h2>Hike Mount Ljuboten</h2>
      <p>
        "The Shar Mountains rise to the clouds for 994 miles along northwestern
        Macedonia, reaching upwards of 8,000 feet. Mount Ljuboten’s prominent
        pointy peak (8,196 feet) demands attention. The five-hour hike to the
        top can be completed in a day. Villa Ljuboten Mountain Resort, a simple
        guesthouse perched at the treeline, at an elevation of 5,500 feet, is a
        great base. From there, follow soft, wildflower-dotted meadows to the
        windy summit. Soak in fantastic views of Macedonia and Kosovo before
        returning to the villa, where a warm fire and the hearty aroma of a
        home-cooked feast greet weary hikers."
      </p>
      <h2>Slither through a cave</h2>
      <p>
        "Macedonia's limestone karst landscape is like Swiss cheese, riddled
        with more than 300 caves. Don a spelunking suit and squeeze through a
        small hole in the rocks to enter the underworld at Gorna Slatinska, a
        quarter-mile labyrinth that lets you through only if you’re willing to
        slither. By light of a headlamp, duck under eerie stalactites and dodge
        tiny bats that dangle from the ceiling. The local caving society, Ursus
        Speleos, researches caves in the area and can show you what they’ve
        found."
      </p>
      <h2>Rock climb or kayak in Matka Canyon</h2>
      <p>
        "Less than 10 miles from Skopje is Matka Canyon, where the Treska River
        weaves past limestone cliffs before pooling in the emerald Matka Lake.
        Drive to the end of the road and nab a table on a stone terrace at the
        Canyon Matka Hotel’s lakefront restaurant. Rent a kayak and paddle
        upriver to Vrelo Cave, a deep chasm with lit pathways and wooden steps
        that leads to underground lakes. For those with less pep, motorboat
        tours are available. Matka Canyon is also a magnet for rock climbers. A
        40-minute hike leads to popular routes, many near the tiny Monastery of
        St. Nicholas Shishovski. If you’re not up for scaling rock walls, take a
        seat on the cliffhanger deck and watch. Macedonia Experience can show
        you around."
      </p>
      <h2>Hike the hills of Mavrovo National Park</h2>
      <p>
        "Mavrovo is Macedonia’s largest national park, cradling the country’s
        highest peak: the 9,068-foot Mount Korab. Bears, lynx, wolves, deer, and
        129 bird species roam the rolling forest and highlands of the park. Base
        yourself at Hotel Tutto, which is tucked into a hillside in the Radika
        River Valley. From there you can explore the park by foot, horse,
        mountain bike, or kayak. Winter is also a good time to visit—with your
        skis in tow."
      </p>
      <h2>Dive into history in Ohrid</h2>
      <p>
        "Click your heels in Ohrid and you might think you’ve been transported
        to the Mediterranean. The crystal clear waters of Ohrid—one of the
        world’s oldest lakes—date back more than a million years. Tucked along
        the lush, hilly shore is the city of Ohrid, home to 56,000 people and
        one of the oldest settlements in Europe. The entire region is designated
        as a UNESCO World Heritage property. Ohrid’s importance in religious
        history is evident in dozens of historic churches and monasteries, such
        as the Church of Saint John at Kaneo, which occupies a prominent perch
        on the edge of the lake. While stunning, it might be outdone by St.
        Panteleimon, the world’s oldest Slav monastery, where the intricate
        rockwork has been meticulously restored. Wander the bustling streets of
        the Old Bazaar before venturing farther afield. To the south, Galicica
        National Park straddles a big hump between Ohrid and Prespa Lakes, which
        can be viewed from the 7,395-foot peak of Magaro Peak. Afterward, hop on
        a boat at Prespa Lake to Golem Grad, also called Snake Island. Yes,
        there are snakes, and more than 200 species of birds, including
        pelicans. Also check out the beautiful frescoes in the 14th-century St.
        Peter’s Church."

      <h2>Paraglide Krusevo’s thermals</h2>
      <p>
        "Krusevo, Macedonia’s highest city at an elevation of more than 4,400
        feet, is nestled along a ridge that rises from the broad Pelagonia
        Valley, a geography that creates steady updrafts perfect for
        paragliding. Colorful wings paint the sky like brushstrokes—swirling,
        climbing, and gliding. Conditions are so prime that the World Air Sports
        Federation held the European Paragliding Championship here in 2016. If
        you’re looking to learn or give it a whirl, Heli XC can assist."
